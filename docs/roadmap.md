**Po-key** is committed to continuous evolution and enhancement to elevate the web development experience. Our roadmap includes the following key objectives:

#### 1. Feature Expansion

- **API Construction**: Strengthening capabilities for developing APIs efficiently.
- **Web Integration**: Streamlining the process of integrating APIs into web applications for seamless functionality.

#### 2. Framework Development

- **Custom API Framework**: Crafting a versatile API framework, departing from dependency on FastAPI. This framework will offer flexibility in adhering to conventions and compatibility with FastAPI-like structures.
- **ASGI Specification Compliance**: Aligning with the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) specification to ensure compatibility and seamless integration across the Python ecosystem.
- **SQL Integration**: Integrating SQL databases using SQLAlchemy that inherently supports asynchronous operations.

#### 3. Enhanced Flexibility

- **Conventional Use**: Providing a flexible system empowering users to craft personalized conventions.
- **Problem Mitigation**: Addressing and rectifying existing issues within FastAPI, especially concerning API documentation for a smoother experience.

#### 4. Protocol Integration

- **WebSocket and HTTP Integration**: Seamlessly integrating WebSocket and HTTP protocols.
- **Specification Standardization**: Developing a proprietary specification compliant with open API standards to standardize and optimize protocol usage.

#### 5. Database Expansions.

- **NoSQL Integration**: Future plans to incorporate NoSQL databases, expanding the range of supported database types for enhanced flexibility and adaptability.

Pypox is dedicated to these objectives, ensuring a more robust, flexible, and integrated web development experience while maintaining compliance with open API standards and protocols.
